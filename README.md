# Car Thang

Hawk Tuah, revive that Car Thing.

This project was started for HackNC 2024. There is a lot more that needs to happen in order to make this project usable by a wider audience, as the installation process is quite involved at the moment.

## Prior Art

We would like to give a massive shoutout to [alexcaoys](https://github.com/alexcaoys). Their work on the [linux-superbird-6.6.y](https://github.com/alexcaoys/linux-superbird-6.6.y) kernel made this entire project possible.

We also must acknowledge the work [bishopdynamics](https://github.com/bishopdynamics) did on [superbird-tool](https://github.com/bishopdynamics/superbird-tool) and of course [frederic](https://github.com/frederic) for introducing Car Thing hacking to the world.
